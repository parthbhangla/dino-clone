# dino-clone

I just cloned Google Chrome's dino for a quick project and as a base for future ideas.


**Functionality:**
- `w` - Big Jump
- `e` - Small Jump
- `s` - Duck
- `r` - Restart
- Continuous and spawns different cacti and bird randomly
- Highscore Track


**ToDo:**
- make it responsive
- build future idead


**Future Ideas:**
- learn [NEAT](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and implement it. Tutorial's on youtube teaching this.
- learn reinforcement learning and implement it.

**Live Site:** [Demo](https://clone-dino.vercel.app/)

You'll have to resize your webpage to see the entire canvas as it's a fixed size.
Give it a shot and try to beat the global highscore.
